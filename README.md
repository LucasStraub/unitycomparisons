# Unity Comparisons

Inside this project I will group some comparisons to measure performance differences inside of them.

  - Code comparisons
  - Overall Unity comparisons
  - Compare different code structures

## Fore, Foreach, List.Foreach and Where(LINQ)
On this test we compare the performance of them iterating a list.

To see what we did on this first comparison you can check the video below
